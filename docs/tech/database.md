# Databases

## Database modeling happens at three levels:

1. **Conceptual** – Maps real-world objects and relationships at a high level.
2. **Logical** – Defines structures to store data, like tables or graphs.
3. **Physical** – Implements these structures in a technical system.

### Evolution of Database Models:
- **First Generation**: **Hierarchical and Network Models** (tree and navigational structures for specific tasks).
- **Second Generation**: **Relational Model** (E.F. Codd's table-based structure, easy to use and mathematically sound).
- **Third Generation**: **Post-Relational Models** (Object-Relational, XML, NoSQL, and NewSQL databases, all tailored to handle modern and complex data structures, especially for Big Data).

Relational databases are reliable but struggle with complex or large data sets, leading to the rise of **NoSQL** and **NewSQL** for high-performance, scalable applications. 

This shift addresses the needs of modern applications, like those involving web data, cloud storage, and Big Data.
