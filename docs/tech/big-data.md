# Big Data and Modern Database Systems

### 1. Introduction to Big Data

Big Data represents a shift in how data is generated, managed, and utilized in various industries, offering insights for decision-making, product adaptation, and operations improvement.

**Key Characteristics of Big Data**:

- **Volume**: Large scale of data generated from various sources.
- **Variety**: Data in multiple formats (e.g., structured, semi-structured, unstructured).
- **Velocity**: High speed of data generation and need for real-time processing.
- **Veracity**: Ensuring data quality and managing inconsistencies and uncertainties.

### 2. Database Systems Overview

Modern database systems are categorized by how they store and handle data. The two primary types are **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)** and **NoSQL Databases**.

#### Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)

- **Primary Use**: Structured data, such as web and business applications.
- **Key Features**: SQL-based querying, defined schemas, ACID transactions for consistency.
- **Limitations**: Limited scalability and flexibility for semi-structured or unstructured data.

#### NoSQL Databases

Designed for high-scale, distributed environments with flexible data handling capabilities, NoSQL databases address the limitations of RDBMS.

**Types of NoSQL Databases**:

1. **Key-Value Stores**: Data stored in key-value pairs.
2. **Document-Oriented**: Stores complex data structures as documents.
3. **Column-Family**: Organizes data in columns for high-volume queries.
4. **Graph Databases**: Optimized for relationships between entities (e.g., social networks).

**Advantages of NoSQL Databases**:

- **Elastic Scaling**: Scalability through horizontal scaling.
- **Flexible Data Models**: Supports dynamic, schema-less data.
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Uses distributed, low-cost commodity servers.
- **Minimal DBA Dependence**: Often comes with self-tuning and automatic distribution features.

**Challenges of NoSQL Databases**:

- **Maturity**: Some are still in developmental stages.
- **Support**: Mostly open-source with limited commercial backing.
- **Complexity in Analytics**: Limited ad-hoc querying; requires programming for complex queries.
- **Expertise**: High demand for specialists with NoSQL knowledge.

#### NewSQL Databases

An evolution of SQL-based systems designed to handle Big Data’s scale with the consistency and querying power of RDBMS, but with the distributed capabilities of NoSQL.

### 3. Data Modeling in NoSQL

NoSQL databases vary in their data models, affecting how data is stored, retrieved, and processed.

**Aggregate-Oriented Models**:

- Organize data in units of related information, or aggregates, for optimized performance in distributed systems.
- Support for atomic manipulation of a single aggregate at a time.

**Aggregate-Ignorant Models**:

- Include RDBMS and graph databases, which do not predefine data organization, allowing for flexible data access.

### 4. Schemalessness in NoSQL

While NoSQL databases do not require a fixed schema, there is often an implicit schema determined by the application interacting with the data, providing flexibility but demanding application-level data structure management.

### 5. Polyglot Persistence

Refers to the strategy of using multiple database technologies within the same application, choosing the optimal storage solution based on specific data and access requirements.

### 6. Big Data Processing Techniques

Different techniques are used to manage Big Data efficiently:

- **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**: Used by RDBMS for fast transactions.
- **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)**: For multidimensional queries, often in data warehousing.
- **RTAP (Real-Time Analytic Processing)**: Supports real-time Big Data processing with continuous data streaming and immediate querying.

### 7. Case Study: Facebook’s Architecture (circa 2010)

Facebook exemplifies the scale challenges that led to the adoption of NoSQL and distributed systems:

- **Cassandra**: NoSQL storage with no single point of failure, used for inbox searches.
- **Hadoop/Hive**: Open-source MapReduce for handling large datasets, with Hive enabling SQL-like querying.
- **Memcached**: Memory caching to reduce database load, providing faster data retrieval.
- **HBase**: Columnar database for real-time processing, built on the Google BigTable model, used for messaging and communication services.
