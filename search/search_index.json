Create a Repository: Click the \"+\" icon in the upper-right corner and select \"New repository.\" Repository Details: Enter a name for your repository, add an optional description, choose the visibility (public or private), and initialize with a README if desired. Create Repository: Click the \"Create repository\" button to finalize. Adding a Repository to Git \u00b6 To add a local repository to GitHub: Initialize Git: In your local project directory, run: git init Add Remote: Link your local repository to GitHub: git remote add origin <repository-URL> Add Files: Stage your files: git add . Commit Changes: Commit your staged files: git commit -m \"Initial commit\" Push to GitHub: Push your changes to the remote repository: git push -u origin master Committing Changes \u00b6 Committing Files: Stage Files: Add files to the staging area: git add <file> Commit Changes: Commit with a message: git commit -m \"Your commit message\" Best Practices for Commit Messages: Be Descriptive: Use clear, concise language to describe the changes. Use Imperative Mood: Write commit messages in imperative mood (e.g., \"Fix bug\" instead of \"Fixed bug\"). Limit Length: Keep the subject line under 50 characters, and use the body for additional details if necessary. Pushing and Pulling Changes \u00b6 Push Changes: Push to Remote: Upload your local commits to the remote repository: git push Pull Changes: Pull from Remote: Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository: git pull Handling Merge Conflicts \u00b6 Merge conflicts occur when changes in different branches clash. To resolve: Pull Latest Changes: Ensure you have the latest changes from the remote branch: git pull Resolve Conflicts: Open the files with conflicts, manually resolve the issues, and save the file. Stage Resolved Files: Add the resolved files: git add <file> Commit Merge: Complete the merge by committing: git commit GitHub Pages \u00b6 GitHub Pages is a feature that allows you to host websites directly from a GitHub repository. It\u2019s commonly used for project documentation, personal blogs, and portfolio sites. Key Features: Static Site Hosting: Ideal for static websites. Jekyll Integration: Supports Jekyll for static site generation. Custom Domains: Allows the use of custom domains. Getting Started: Create a Repository: Make a new repository on GitHub. Add Your Site Files: Commit your HTML/CSS/JavaScript files to the repository. Enable GitHub Pages: Go to the repository settings, find the GitHub Pages section, and choose the branch to deploy. GitHub Actions \u00b6 GitHub Actions is a CI/CD and automation tool integrated into GitHub. It allows you to automate workflows directly in your GitHub repository. Key Features: Workflows: Define workflows using YAML files. Actions: Reusable units of code that perform specific tasks. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment: Automate testing and deployment processes. Getting Started: Create a Workflow File: Add a .github/workflows directory and create a YAML file. Define Triggers: Specify the events that trigger the workflow (e.g., push, pull request). Add Jobs and Steps: Define the jobs and steps to run within the workflow. Example Workflow: name: CI on: [push] jobs: build: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Checkout code uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Set up Node.js uses: actions/setup-node@v2 with: node-version: \"14\" - name: Install dependencies run: npm install - name: Run tests run: npm test","title":"GitHub Documentation"},{"location":"tech/github/#github","text":"","title":"GitHub"},{"location":"tech/github/#creating-a-new-repository","text":"To create a new repository on GitHub: Go to GitHub: Navigate to GitHub and log in to your account.
